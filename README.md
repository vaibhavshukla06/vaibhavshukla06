### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Vaibhav**]([https://ogvaibhavshukla.netlify.app/]), a engineer based in Germany.

I am learning blockchain devlopement from Cyfrin Updraft .

I spend most of my time learning things I don’t know yet, then figuring out how to bring them into life with code.

Outside of code and Figma, you’ll find me reading manhuaus, or hitting the gym. I also enjoy sketching
#### Fun Facts:

* I don’t like coffee or tea.
* Solo Leveling is my favorite manhua.
